This folder implements Co-Training and PU-Learning techniques in python for detecting opinion spam in Yelp reviews

## Installation

Before running the algorithms clean the data using [cleanData](https://github.com/anubha2704/IndependentStudy/blob/master/cleanData.py).

Next use [data_Analysis](https://github.com/anubha2704/IndependentStudy/blob/master/data_Analysis.py) to extract features from the dataset. 

Use the file with extracted features and run [co-training](https://github.com/anubha2704/IndependentStudy/blob/master/co-training.py) algorithm for opinion spam detection model testing.

(Currently, the code is built in such a way that one needs to add datafile paths in the respective python files to get results)
